    " You may want to consult with Matt briefly on how to use the fluoresence microscope with the GigaCE commands. In particular, you will want to record what excitation channel he is using ('cyan', 'blue', etc...) and what emission channel he is using (1, 2, 3, etc...). Although I think the defaults I have chosen are correct. \n",
