The first step of the method should be the first step you want to perform following lysing and loading a cell into the capillary (ie. separation step). The method should end at the well where the cells are plated, or wherever you would like to regain manual control over the instrument. \n",

    "1. **Delay** is the amount of time to delay the injection steps after running the cell, the word 'Fire' will be printed once the delay is finished.\n",
    "1. **Gravity drop** is how far to lower the outlet in mm from its current position. \n",
    "1. **Voltage level** is the amount of voltage to apply. \n",

    "In the first way the cell is loaded using a preset amount of time. The injection volume will be much more consistent, but if the cell is not loaded, the user will either choose to run a blank (no cell), rinse the capillary to remove the ECB, or start the auto-method. \n",
    "\n",
    "The second way, the loading parameters are held till the user presses the space-bar to continue the run. The injection volume may change run to run, but the user decides when to stop which means a higher likely-hood over loading a cell (at the expense of possible greater de-stacking. \n",
