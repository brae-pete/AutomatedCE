# Automated method for a CE System 				
# Columns are delimited by tabs (not commas) and column order should be matched				
"# Default units for outlet is cm, for inlet is mm, for voltage is kV for time is seconds, you may enter in cm, mm, kv, s, min to specify other units"""""""				
"# Chip specifies microchip method, VOLTAGE CHANNELS specifies the order of the voltage channels in the method"				
"# For chip voltages, 0 is a buffered 0 V output, G is a connected to ground via a resistor, T the channel is left open  (floating, tri-state). "
