# Example Template File Format				
"# Template files have three sections, ""SIZE"", """"WELLS"""" and """"LEDGES"""""""				
"# ""SIZE should be defined before ""WELLS"" and ""WELLS should be defined before ""LEDGES"""				
# Wells contain XY coordinates for the XY stage to move to place well underneath capillary				
# XY units are in mm				
# Ledges contain Heights (in mm) that indicate a safe inlet height to travel at when crossing the specified area.				
"# Size is dX,dY or dRadius depending on if 'rectangle' or 'circle' is the shape """
