### Thorlabs Kinesis

Download Thorlabs Kinesis from their website and restart the computer. Load the software and check the labjack can be accessed by kinesis. If the labjack is new you will need to make sure the correct Serial number is recorded in the Thorlabs Labjack Class. 

### Digilent Waveforms
Download Digilent Waveforms from the digilent inc. website. Install waveforms to your computer and verify you can access the Analog Discovery or desired device from the waveforms software. 

### Hardware Functionality

Create a new CESystems class or use a pre-defined class. Make sure that every function in the class works ( or at least the functions you require).
When your CESystems class is working, change the CESystems subclass object under CEControl. Alternatively you can make your own program using the CESystems.
For testing new functionality you may find it is easier to run CESystems from a Console, or Jupyter Notebook then when the
changes have been finalized move to adding it to the GUI.
